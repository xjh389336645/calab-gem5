## To connect memory system components together, gem5 uses a port abstraction. 
## Each memory object can have two kinds of ports, request ports and response ports. 
## Requests are sent from a request port to a response port, and responses are sent from a response port to a request port.
##  When connecting ports, you must connect a request port to a response port.

# Note: these are directly connected to the memory bus and are not cached

## Other ISAs (e.g., ARM) do not require these 3 extra lines.
